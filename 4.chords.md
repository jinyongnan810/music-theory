### major triads take scale degrees 1 3 5 from a major scale.
- C E G make up C major chord.

  - D minor(D F A)
  - E minor(E G B)
  - F major(F A C)
  - G major(G B D)
  - A minor(A C E)
  - B diminished(B D F)
    - diminished is kind of like super minor.

### inversions
- are the case when the root note is not the lowest note.
- They smooth out the transition between chords.

### Roman numerals

  - in C major scale, I is C major, ii is D minor, iii is E minor, IV is F major, V is G major, vi is A minor, vii째 is B diminished.
- capital for major, lowercase for minor, 째 for diminished.

### Major and minor triads

- major triads have major 3rd(2 whole step), minor triads have minor 3rd(1.5 whole step).
- and the 5th note is the same for both major and minor triads.
- The diminished triads have minor 3rd and minor 5th.
- The augmented triads have major 3rd and major 5th.(not naturally exists in major key)


### 7th chords
- 7th chords are 4 note chords.
- major triads + major 7th = major 7th chords(M7)
  - half step below the octave.
- minor triads + minor 7th = minor 7th chords(m7)
  - whole step below the octave.
- major triads + minor 7th = dominant 7th chords(7)
  - usually used in blues.

### chord progressions in minor keys
