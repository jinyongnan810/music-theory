# Chords
## Triads
- chords with 3 notes.
- aka Ternary Harmony

### major triads take scale degrees 1 3 5 from a major scale.
- C E G make up C major chord.
- G B D make up G major chord.

### diatonic chord progressions
- in C major scale, each diatonic chord treats one note as the tonic, and take 1,3,5 from that note. Which makes up 7 diatonic chords.
  - C major(C E G)
  - D minor(D F A)
  - E minor(E G B)
  - F major(F A C)
  - G major(G B D)
  - A minor(A C E)
  - B diminished(B D F)
    - diminished is kind of like super minor.

### inversions
- are the case when the root note is not the lowest note.
- They smooth out the transition between chords.
