# Keys
## Tricks to determine major keys
- if a key is in sharps
  - take the last sharp, and move up half step, that is the key.
  - special rule: if the pitch half step above is defined as sharp, than the pitch with sharp is the key.
- if a key is in flats
  - only 1 flat: F major
  - else: take the second to last flat, that is the key.
- no accidentals: C major
