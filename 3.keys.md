# Keys
## Tricks to determine major keys
- if a key is in sharps
  - take the last sharp, and move up half step, that is the key.
  - special rule: if the pitch half step above is defined as sharp, than the pitch with sharp is the key.
- if a key is in flats
  - only 1 flat: F major
  - else: take the second to last flat, that is the key.
- no accidentals: C major

## Minor keys
- minor keys are relative to major keys.
- there are 3 types of minor keys: natural, harmonic, melodic.

### natural minor
- There are 3 ways to make a minor key.
- 
#### Relative minor
- the 6th note of a major scale is the tonic of a natural minor scale.
- C major: C D E F G A B C
- A minor: A B C D E F G A

#### Whole-half step pattern
- WHWWHWW

#### Parallel minor
- the natural minor scale with the same tonic as the major scale.
- C major: C D E F G A B C
- C minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C

### harmonic minor
- raise the 7th note of natural minor scale by half step.
- the reason is to make the 7th note a leading tone, which is a half step below the tonic.

### melodic minor
- raise the 6th and 7th note of natural minor scale by half step.
- usually used in ascending, and natural minor scale is used in descending.
