### tonic and scale degrees and solfege
- Tonic is the beginning and the ending of a scale, or the note scale named after.
  - in C major, tonic is C.
- Scale degrees is the position of a note in a scale.(from 1 to 7)
  - in C major G is 5.
- Solfege: Do Re Mi Fa So Ra Ti Do
  - moveable solfege means: define Do as the tonic of a scale, and then the other notes are named relative to that tonic.
    - matching scale degrees and solfege: Do is 1, Re is 2, etc.
  - fixed solfege means: Do is always C, Re is always D, etc.
